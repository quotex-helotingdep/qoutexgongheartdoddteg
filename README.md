## What is a Bonus Code or Promo Code in Quotex?

A bonus code, also known as a promo code in Quotex, is a special word,
character, or a mix of letters, numbers, and characters that you can use
in the promo area in a Quotex deposit process to get extra money for
FREE.

If you have access to any promo code, you must use them to:

1.  Increase your trading capital
2.  Get free extra cash for trading money

Plus, Quotex promo codes and bonuses are not limited to a maximum of 50%
extra cash; you can sometimes get bonuses as high as 100%.

Keep checking this section of our blog to find out if there is a new
bonus for next month.

## How to use Quotex promo codes step-by-step

### Step 1: Register to activate the promo code.

One thing that you will notice if you try to use my promo code on your
existing account is, it is not available.

This means that my promo code is only available to new Quotex users.

To solve this issue, just click on any of the registration buttons on
this blog post to register.

## Other bonuses to take advantage of in Quotex

1.  **Risk-free trades:** this is a special kind of bonus offered to
    active traders to use in their daily trading. As the name suggests,
    Quotex risk-free trades are trades that remove all the risks from
    trading.
2.  **Cashback:** This kind of bonus is more or less the same as the
    risk-free trades bonus but with a twist. Unlike risk-free trades
    that give you back all your lost money, cashback allows you to only
    receive a percentage of your trading volume back.
3.  **Cancel X points:** This is a tool used on Quotex to cancel a
    losing trade. If you use this tool you will salvage your money if
    your trade is losing.
4.  **Percentage of turnover:** This promo bonus allows you to get a
    percentage of your trading volume back when you trade.
